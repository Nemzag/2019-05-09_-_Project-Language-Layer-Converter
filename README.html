                <h2>Project I.D.E. Language Layer Converter&nbsp;:</h2>
                <p>A layer interface in I.D.E.,<br>
                    vrom code, display and user,<br>
                    who will allow to use national &amp; ethnic languages in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, C and any programming languages,<br>
                    by using “<code>substitution() {};</code>” pro function’s, method’s, tag’s, propertie’s, rule’s, attribute’s…<br>
                    Like this,<br>
                    you didn't have to learn English or use it, in your page.<br>
                    And instead use your mother tongue.</p>

                <p>The code (function, tag) will remain in English inside the file,<br>
                    by respect to their creator’s & inventor’s,<br>
                    but the user’s vill view the code in their own language’s.</p>

                <p>You need to comprehend,<br>
                    that lot of nation’s of keyboard’s with different scripts,<br>
                    maybe we can change keyboard layout or use two keyboard,<br>
                    but it's annoying pro beginners,<br>
                    because every layout have a different key position configuration,<br>
                    {this one of the reason why I imagined my Project Unifio Clarifio}<br>
                    and everybody don't know English,<br>
                    so it’s a barrier pro some to be able to create projects (H.T.M.L., C#, P.H.P.…),<br>
                    this is the reason why I plan to make this,<br>
                    to help these kinds of people’s.</p>

                <p>And there is no need to learn wrong or bad language’s to be able to pro‑ɣram,<br>
                    it’s use‑less and dangerous pro national identity.</p>
