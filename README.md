# Project-Language-Layer-Converter
A layer interface in I.D.E.,  
vrom code, display and user,  
who will allow to use national &amp; ethnic languages in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, C and any programming languages,  
by using “`substitution() {};`” pro function’s, method’s, tag’s, propertie’s, rule’s, attribute’s…  
Like this,  
you didn't have to learn English or use it, in your page.  
And instead use your mother tongue.

The code (function, tag) will remain in English inside the file,
by respect to their creator’s & inventor’s,  
but the user’s vill view the code in their own language’s.

You need to comprehend,  
that lot of nation’s of keyboard’s with different scripts,  
maybe we can change keyboard layout or use two keyboard,  
but it's annoying pro beginners,  
and everybody don't know English,  
so it’s a barrier pro some to be able to create projects (H.T.M.L., C#, P.H.P.…),  
this is the reason why I plan to make this,  
to help these kinds of people’s.

And there is no need to learn wrong or bad language’s to be able to pro‑ɣram,  
it use‑less and dangerous pro national identity.
